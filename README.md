## Intro
TDB
## Usage
GoVizzy will work on any system with a supported version on Python and Pip installed.

Simply run the build.sh script, which will install all dependencies in a virtual environment, and launch GoVizzy.

## Testing

In order to run tests, the test script expects the `.venv` folder to have been
created by the `build.sh` script. Otherwise the test will throw an error.

To execute the test script perform:
```bash
$ ./test.sh
```
