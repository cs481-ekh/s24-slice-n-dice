# Building and Running GoVizzy

## Intro
GoVizzy is a Jupyter Notebook that runs a Python module.

The program is interacted with exclusively through the Jupyter interface.

## Build Script
The build.sh script configures the environment, installs dependencies, and launches GoVizzy.

When running the program for the first time, the script will perform all setup tasks, then launch GoVizzy when ready.

If the script detects that GoVizzy has been run previously and is in a runnable state, it starts the program only.

To force a reinstall of GoVizzy's dependencies and libraries, the clean script must be run.

### Environment Cleanup
The included clean.sh script deletes the GoVizzy virtual environment entirely.

This allows for a fresh install to be made should problems arise.

This DOES NOT remove any data inputted by the user or any output files generated by GoVizzy.

### Automated Tests
See the [test documentation](testing.md).
