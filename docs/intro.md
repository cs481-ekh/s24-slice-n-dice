# GoVizzy

## Introduction
GoVizzy is a Python module wrapped in a Jupyter Notebook UI that allows users to view multiple types of 3D renderings and 2D slices of molecules and atoms.

Data is entered into GoVizzy in the standard .cube file format. The user can then see the data in the file plotted in many different ways, with real time interactivity.

GoVizzy was a Senior Design Project (SDP) sponsored by Dr. Oliviero Andreussi of the BSU Chemistry Department.
