# Building and Running GoVizzy

## How To
GoVizzy is a Jupyter Notebook and integrated Python library.

The included build.sh script will create a virtual environment for GoVizzy,
install all needed dependencies, and start a Jupyter session.

$ ./build.sh

### Environment Cleanup
The included clean.sh script deletes the GoVizzy virtual environment entirely.
This allows for a fresh install to be made should problems arise.

This DOES NOT remove any data inputted by the user or any output files generated by GoVizzy.

### Automated Tests
See the [test documentation](testing.md).
